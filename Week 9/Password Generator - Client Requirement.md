# Requirement

The client requires you to build a password generator that asks the user to enter the following data:

- How many letters would you like in your password?

- How many symbols would you like in your password?

- How many digits would you like in your password?

Based on this data, your program should generate a password that meets the requirements.


Below is an example execution of the program:
> How many letters would you like in your password? `10`

> How many symbols would you like in your password? `5`

> How many digits would you like in your password? `3`

> Here is your password: s2u$jG#n7f!he^Y4P(
